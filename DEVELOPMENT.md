# Development Notes

## Project Setup

### Virtual Environment
- Each machine needs its own virtual environment
- Activate before working on the project:
  - MacBook: `source venv/bin/activate`
  - Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Machine-Specific Notes

#### Windows PC
- Primary development machine
- Uses PowerShell (may need execution policy adjustment)
- If PowerShell restrictions occur:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

#### MacBook
- Secondary development machine
- Uses zsh shell
- No PowerShell restrictions

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
1. Always pull before starting work
2. Make changes
3. Commit with descriptive messages
4. Push to GitHub
5. On other machine, pull changes

### Package Management
- When adding new packages:
  1. Install in venv: `pip install <package-name>`
  2. Update requirements: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
  3. Commit updated requirements.txt
  4. On other machine: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Project Context

### Key Components
1. `listener.py`: Core number-finding module
2. `crossword_solver.py`: Grid and solving logic
3. `puzzle_reader.py`: Image processing and OCR
4. `app.py`: Flask web application (MAIN ENTRY POINT)
5. `interactive_solver.py`: Interactive solving interface
6. `dev_server.py`: Development server with auto-reload

### Architecture: Web Application Components

#### `app.py` - Flask Web Application
**Purpose**: Main web application with user authentication and database persistence
- **Features**: User registration/login, session management, API endpoints
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM (stored in `instance/crossword_solver.db`)
- **API Endpoints**: Save/load puzzle state, user authentication
- **Templates**: HTML templates for web interface

#### `interactive_solver.py` - Interactive Solving Engine
**Purpose**: Core interactive puzzle solving with constraint propagation
- **Features**: Real-time constraint propagation, solution selection, undo/deselect
- **Interface**: HTML generation with JavaScript interactivity
- **State Management**: Tracks solving history and user selections

#### `dev_server.py` - Development Server
**Purpose**: Auto-reloading development server (similar to nodemon)
- **Features**: File watching, automatic restart on changes
- **Usage**: `python dev_server.py` for development

### Architecture Flow
```
User Request â†’ Flask (app.py) â†’ Interactive Solver â†’ Database
                    â†“
            HTML Templates + JavaScript
                    â†“
            Real-time Constraint Propagation
```

## Development Tips
1. **Always activate virtual environment** before running the application
2. **Use development server** (`python dev_server.py`) for auto-reload during development
3. **Database location**: `instance/crossword_solver.db` (Flask default)
4. **Test user registration** and login flow regularly
5. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors and API communication

### 2024-12-19: Interactive Solver Enhancements - Deselect & Cleanup

#### Key Achievements
- **Implemented deselect functionality** allowing users to remove individual solutions and restore original possibilities
- **Removed JSON dependencies** - solver now uses pure object-based approach with stored original solutions
- **Enhanced visual distinction** between user-selected solutions (blue) and algorithm-determined solutions (teal)
- **Fixed variable naming conflicts** in JavaScript constraint recalculation functions
- **Maintained undo functionality** while adding targeted deselect capability

#### Technical Details
- **Deselect Dialog**: Yellow-themed confirmation dialog with "Deselect Solution" and "Cancel" buttons
- **Smart Cell Handling**: Deselecting only removes cells not used by other user-selected clues
- **Original Solution Storage**: Stores initial solutions at initialization for reliable restoration
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - User-selected solutions: Blue background with blue left border
  - Algorithm-solved clues: Teal background with teal left border
  - Multiple solutions: Yellow background (unchanged)
- **Accurate Solution Counts**: Shows actual remaining solutions, not just "1" when user has selected something

#### Files Modified
- `interactive_solver.py` - Added deselect functionality, removed JSON dependencies, enhanced styling
- `interactive_solver.html` - Generated updated interface with new features

#### Current Status
âœ… **Deselect functionality** working correctly  
âœ… **JSON dependencies removed** - pure object-based approach  
âœ… **Visual distinction** between solution types implemented  
âœ… **Undo system** maintained and enhanced  
âœ… **Smart backtracking** allowing selective solution removal  
ðŸ”„ **Next phase**: User registration and progress saving  

#### Lessons Learned
- **Variable naming conflicts** in JavaScript can silently break functionality
- **Object-based approach** is more reliable than external file dependencies
- **User experience** benefits from both targeted deselect and full undo capabilities
- **Visual feedback** helps users understand the difference between their choices and algorithmic determinations
- **State management** requires careful tracking of original vs. current solutions

### 2024-12-19: Interactive Solver Development

#### Key Achievements
- **Developed interactive crossword solver** (`interactive_solver.py`) for human-guided solving
- **Fixed unclued clue handling** to prevent massive 900,000 solution sets
- **Created hybrid interface** with dropdowns for clued clues and input boxes for unclued clues
- **Implemented real-time solution counting** showing current valid solutions for each clue
- **Built responsive HTML interface** with clickable clues and solution selection

#### Technical Details
- **Unclued Clue Optimization**: Modified `clue_classes.py` to initialize unclued clues with empty solution sets instead of all possible numbers
- **Constraint-Based Population**: Unclued clues only get populated with solutions when constraints are first applied
- **Hybrid UI Design**: 
  - Clued clues: Dropdown menus with pre-computed valid solutions
  - Unclued clues: Text input boxes for manual entry
- **Real-Time Updates**: Solution counts reflect current valid solutions after constraint propagation
- **Event Handling**: JavaScript manages both dropdown and input interactions

#### Files Created/Modified
- `interactive_solver.py` - Complete interactive solver with HTML generation
- `clue_classes.py` - Enhanced with proper unclued clue handling
- `interactive_solver.html` - Generated interactive interface
- Removed redundant files: `puzzle_solution_export.txt`, `debug_grid_issues.py`, etc.

#### Current Status
âœ… **Interactive solver** fully functional with modern UI  
âœ… **Unclued clue optimization** preventing massive data structures  
âœ… **Hybrid interface** supporting both clue types  
âœ… **Real-time solution counting** working correctly  
ðŸ”„ **Next phase**: Implement constraint propagation and grid updates  

#### Lessons Learned
- **Data Structure Efficiency**: Unclued clues should start empty and populate on-demand
- **User Experience**: Different clue types need different interaction patterns
- **Constraint Propagation**: Real-time updates require careful state management
- **Code Reuse**: Interactive solver benefits from automated solver's clue classes

## Future Enhancements
1. **Mobile optimization** - Better touch interface
2. **Social features** - Share solutions, leaderboards
3. **Advanced solving** - AI hints, difficulty levels
4. **Puzzle creation** - Tools for creating new puzzles
5. **Export features** - PDF solutions, progress reports
