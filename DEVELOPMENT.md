  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

#### MacBook
- Secondary development machine
- Uses zsh shell
- No PowerShell restrictions

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow

2. Make changes
3. Commit with descriptive messages
4. Push to GitHub
5. On other machine, pull changes

### Package Management
- When adding new packages:
  1. Install in venv: `pip install <package-name>`
  2. Update requirements: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
  3. Commit updated requirements.txt
  4. On other machine: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Project Context

### Key Components
1. `listener.py`: Core number-finding module
2. `crossword_solver.py`: Grid and solving logic
3. `puzzle_reader.py`: Image processing and OCR

### Architecture: Grid Parsing Components

#### `systematic_grid_parser.py` - Low-Level Grid Parser
**Purpose**: Core grid structure detection and clue boundary analysis
- **Input**: Grid image only
- **Process**: Detects thick borders, finds clue boundaries, maps cell indices
- **Output**: `ClueTuple` objects with cell positions (no clue parameters)
- **Key Features**: 
  - Uses ground truth border data for accuracy
  - 0-63 cell indexing system
  - Handles ACROSS/DOWN clue detection
  - Special case handling (e.g., Clue 1 in both directions)

#### `puzzle_reader.py` - High-Level Puzzle Interface
**Purpose**: Complete puzzle processing and data integration
- **Input**: Grid image + Clues image + Systematic parser results
- **Process**: Combines grid structure with clue parameters (b, c values)
- **Output**: Complete `ListenerClue` objects ready for solving
- **Key Features**:
  - Orchestrates the entire puzzle reading process
  - Integrates clue parameters from separate source
  - Converts to solver-compatible formats
  - Provides user-friendly output and visualization

#### Relationship Flow
```
Grid Image â†’ systematic_grid_parser.py â†’ ClueTuples (cell positions)
Clues Image â†’ puzzle_reader.py â†’ Clue parameters (b, c values)
                    â†“
            Complete ListenerClue objects
                    â†“
            crossword_solver.py
```

**Design Benefits**:
- **Modularity**: Grid parsing can be improved independently
- **Reusability**: Systematic parser can be used by other components
- **Testability**: Each component can be tested separately
- **Future-Proofing**: Easy to swap out grid parsing or clue reading methods

### Important Decisions
- Using OpenCV and Tesseract for OCR
- Using SymPy for prime number operations
- 8x8 grid structure

### Known Issues
- Image quality crucial for OCR accuracy
- Need good lighting for puzzle photos
- Tesseract installation required on both machines

## Development Tips
1. Test OCR with small sections first
2. Keep puzzle images in `images/` directory
3. Use high-resolution images (min 1200x1200)
4. Avoid OneDrive/iCloud sync issues by using GitHub

## Future Enhancements
1. Add support for different grid sizes
2. Implement parallel processing
3. Add graphical user interface
4. Add support for different clue formats
5. Implement solution verification
