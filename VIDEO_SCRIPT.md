### Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hi, I'm Neil Walker, and this is my CS50 final project - a sophisticated mathematical crossword solver that evolved far beyond my original vision thanks to AI-assisted development with Cursor.

What started as a simple command-line puzzle solver became a full-stack web application with real-time interactivity, user authentication, and advanced constraint satisfaction algorithms."

### Key Innovation: AI-Assisted Development (45 seconds)
*[Show file structure and code examples]*

"The real story here is how Cursor AI transformed my development process. Instead of spending hours on tedious HTML/CSS styling and debugging JavaScript syntax errors, I could focus on pushing my programming boundaries.

Cursor AI helped me implement features I never thought I'd have time for:
- Real-time constraint propagation
- Sophisticated undo/redo systems
- User authentication and database management
- Interactive anagram solving stages

This freed up development time to explore advanced concepts like SQLAlchemy ORM, session management, and complex algorithmic thinking."

### Live Demo: Core Functionality (60 seconds)
*[Screen recording of the application]*

"Let me show you the solver in action. Here's the interactive interface where users can:

1. **Select solutions** from computed possibilities
2. **See real-time constraint propagation** - when I choose a solution, incompatible options are automatically filtered out
3. **Use the undo system** - complete solution history with selective restoration
4. **Experience the anagram stage** - after completing the initial puzzle, users face a second challenge where every entry must be an anagram of the original

Notice the color coding: blue for user-selected solutions, green for algorithm-determined ones, and yellow for multiple possibilities."

### Technical Architecture (30 seconds)
*[Show key files and explain structure]*

"The application combines multiple programming paradigms:
- **Flask backend** with SQLAlchemy ORM for user management
- **Interactive JavaScript frontend** with real-time updates
- **Mathematical algorithms** for prime factorization and constraint satisfaction
- **Database persistence** for cross-device progress synchronization

Each component demonstrates different CS50 concepts, from basic web development to advanced algorithmic thinking."

### Learning Outcomes & AI Collaboration (30 seconds)
*[Show documentation and learning points]*

"Working with Cursor AI taught me something crucial about modern development: AI isn't just about writing code faster - it's about thinking bigger. I could focus on architectural decisions, user experience design, and learning new technologies rather than getting stuck on syntax details.

The AI helped document our learning journey, creating comprehensive documentation that captures not just what we built, but why we made certain decisions and how we overcame challenges."

### Conclusion (15 seconds)
"This project demonstrates that with the right tools and mindset, you can build applications that go far beyond basic requirements. The combination of human creativity and AI assistance allowed me to explore advanced programming concepts while creating something genuinely useful and educational.

Thank you for watching!"
