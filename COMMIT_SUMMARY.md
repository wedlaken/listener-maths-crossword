# Commit Summary - July 2025

## üéâ Project Status: READY FOR COMMIT

The Listener Maths Crossword project has reached a major milestone with a fully functional, enhanced interactive solver that successfully handles both the initial puzzle and the anagram challenge stages.

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Core Functionality
- **Complete Interactive Solver**: Successfully used to complete the entire puzzle
- **Two-Stage Puzzle Support**: Initial grid + anagram grid with seamless transition
- **Enhanced Undo Functionality**: Fixed undo issues in anagram grid with proper state restoration
- **State Persistence**: Both initial and anagram grid states properly saved/restored
- **Flask Integration**: Web application with database persistence working correctly

### Technical Improvements
- **Port Configuration**: Updated all documentation to use port 5001 (avoiding AirPlay conflict on macOS)
- **Database Migration**: Anagram state columns properly added to database
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Improved button naming, conditional display, and layout
- **Code Organization**: Test files moved to proper directory structure

### Documentation Updates
- **Fixed Port References**: Updated all .md files to reference port 5001 instead of 5000
- **Current Status**: PROJECT_STATUS.md reflects latest improvements
- **Development Notes**: DEVELOPMENT.md includes recent enhancements
- **Learning Points**: LEARNING_POINTS.md documents technical solutions

## üöÄ Ready for Deployment

### Local Development
