  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

## Strategic Decision: From OCR to Ground Truth Data

### Initial Approach: OCR and Image Processing
The project began with an ambitious approach using **OpenCV and Tesseract OCR** for automated puzzle parsing:

- **Image Processing**: OpenCV for grid detection and cell boundary identification
- **OCR Detection**: Tesseract for reading clue numbers from grid cells
- **Dynamic Border Detection**: Algorithmic identification of thick borders between clues
- **Automated Parsing**: Computer vision techniques to extract puzzle structure

### OCR Challenges Encountered
During development, several significant challenges emerged:

1. **OCR Accuracy Issues**: Tesseract struggled with small, printed numbers in grid cells
2. **Image Quality Dependencies**: Results varied significantly based on image resolution and lighting
3. **Border Detection Complexity**: Algorithmic detection of thick borders was inconsistent
4. **Development Bottleneck**: Debugging OCR issues consumed significant development time
5. **Cross-Platform Issues**: OCR setup and dependencies varied across development environments
6. **Learning Focus**: OCR debugging was taking time away from core programming concepts

### Strategic Transition: Ground Truth Data
To maintain project momentum and focus on core algorithmic development, the decision was made to **transition to ground truth data**:

#### What Changed
- **Manual Clue Parsing**: Clue parameters manually extracted from puzzle images using online tools
- **Hard-coded Grid Structure**: Border positions and clue numbers manually determined and hard-coded
- **Text-based Input**: Clue data stored in simple text files (`data/Listener 4869 clues.txt`)
- **Reliable Foundation**: Eliminated OCR dependencies for consistent, predictable behavior

#### Benefits Achieved
1. **Reliability**: 100% accurate data input, eliminating OCR errors
2. **Development Speed**: Focus shifted from debugging OCR to core algorithm development
3. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: No dependency on system-specific OCR installations
4. **Maintainability**: Simple text files easier to modify and version control
5. **Learning Focus**: More time available for advanced programming concepts and web development

#### Current Data Sources
- **`data/Listener 4869 clues.txt`**: Manually parsed clue parameters in b:c format
- **`systematic_grid_parser.py`**: Hard-coded border positions and clue number locations
- **Ground truth validation**: All puzzle data verified manually for accuracy

### Future OCR Development
While the current implementation uses ground truth data, the framework remains in place for future OCR integration:

- **OCR Infrastructure**: OpenCV and Tesseract setup maintained for future use
- **Image Processing**: Grid detection algorithms preserved
- **Hybrid Approach**: Potential to combine OCR with ground truth validation
- **Machine Learning**: Future possibility of ML-enhanced number recognition

## Development Tips
1. **Always activate virtual environment** before running the application
2. **Use development server** (`python dev_server.py`) for auto-reload during development
3. **Database location**: `instance/crossword_solver.db` (Flask default)
4. **Test user registration** and login flow regularly
5. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors and API communication
6. **Ground truth data**: Verify clue parameters in `data/Listener 4869 clues.txt` for accuracy
