## Image Capture Guidelines

### Image Organization
1. **Grid Image**
   - Take a separate photo of the 8x8 grid
   - Crop tightly around the grid to minimize background
   - Ensure all grid lines are visible
   - Make sure clue numbers in cells are clear
   - Save as `grid.jpg` or `grid.png`

2. **Clue List Image**
   - Take a photo of the clue list
   - Can be one image of both columns (Across and Down)
   - Ensure text is clear and well-lit
   - Save as `clues.jpg` or `clues.png`

### Image Capture Tips
1. **Lighting**
   - Use even, bright lighting
   - Avoid shadows and glare
   - Natural daylight works well
   - Avoid flash if possible

2. **Camera Position**
   - Hold camera parallel to the paper
   - Avoid angles that distort the grid
   - Ensure the entire grid/clue list is in frame
   - Keep the image as straight as possible

3. **Image Quality**
   - Use highest resolution available
   - Ensure focus is sharp
   - Check that all numbers are readable
   - Verify grid lines are clear

4. **File Format**
   - Preferred: `.jpg` or `.png`
   - Minimum resolution: 1200x1200 pixels
   - Maximum file size: 5MB
   - Color mode: RGB or grayscale

### Image Processing
The program can handle either:
1. **Separate Images**
   - Process grid and clues separately
   - More control over each component
   - Easier to retake if one part is unclear

2. **Combined Image**
   - Single photo of entire puzzle
   - Must be well-lit and clear
   - More challenging for OCR
