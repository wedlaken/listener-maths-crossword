# Listener Maths Crossword Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project aims to solve mathematical crossword puzzles using a combination of image processing, OCR, and constraint satisfaction algorithms. The puzzle consists of an 8x8 grid with mathematical clues that follow specific rules about prime factors and their differences.

## Current Progress

### 1. Core Components Created

#### `listener.py`
- Core module for finding numbers with specific properties:
  - Number of digits (a)
  - Number of prime factors (b)
  - Difference between largest and smallest prime factor (c)
- Uses `sympy` for prime number operations
- Provides `find_solutions()` function that returns all valid numbers for given parameters

#### `crossword_solver.py`
- Implements the crossword grid structure
- Handles clue placement and validation
- Uses backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle
- Integrates with `listener.py` to generate possible solutions for each clue

#### `puzzle_reader.py`
- Uses OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to process puzzle images
- Detects grid structure and black cells
- Reads clue numbers and values from the grid
- Parses clue parameters from the clue list
- Creates a CrosswordGrid object ready for solving

### 2. Current State

The project is in a working state with the following capabilities:
- Can process mathematical clues with parameters (a, b, c)
- Can detect and parse an 8x8 grid from an image
- Can identify clue numbers and their positions
- Can determine clue directions (across/down) and lengths
- Can generate possible solutions for each clue
- Can solve the complete puzzle using constraint satisfaction

### 3. Next Steps

1. **Image Processing Improvements**
   - Test with actual puzzle images
   - Fine-tune OCR parameters for better accuracy
   - Add error handling for unclear images

2. **Clue Processing**
   - Verify clue format parsing ("22 2 : 1427")
   - Add validation for clue parameters
   - Handle edge cases in clue direction detection

3. **Solving Algorithm**
   - Optimize the backtracking algorithm
   - Add progress tracking
   - Implement solution verification

4. **User Interface**
   - Add command-line interface for image input
   - Add progress display
   - Add solution visualization

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Tesseract OCR
- SymPy

### Installation Requirements
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pytesseract sympy
```

### System Requirements
- Tesseract OCR installed on the system
- Sufficient memory for image processing
- Python virtual environment (recommended)

## Usage

1. Take a photo of the puzzle
2. Run the puzzle reader:
```python
reader = PuzzleReader('puzzle_image.jpg')
grid = reader.process_puzzle()
```

3. Solve the puzzle:
```python
if grid.solve():
    print("Solution found!")
    grid.print_grid()
```

## Notes
- The project uses a virtual environment for dependency management
- Image quality is crucial for accurate OCR
- The solving algorithm may need optimization for larger puzzles

## Future Enhancements
1. Add support for different grid sizes
2. Implement parallel processing for faster solving
3. Add a graphical user interface
4. Add support for different clue formats
5. Implement solution verification and validation

## Image Capture Guidelines

### Image Organization
1. **Grid Image**
   - Take a separate photo of the 8x8 grid
   - Crop tightly around the grid to minimize background
   - Ensure all grid lines are visible
   - Make sure clue numbers in cells are clear
   - Save as `grid.jpg` or `grid.png`

2. **Clue List Image**
   - Take a photo of the clue list
   - Can be one image of both columns (Across and Down)
   - Ensure text is clear and well-lit
   - Save as `clues.jpg` or `clues.png`

### Image Capture Tips
1. **Lighting**
   - Use even, bright lighting
   - Avoid shadows and glare
   - Natural daylight works well
   - Avoid flash if possible

2. **Camera Position**
   - Hold camera parallel to the paper
   - Avoid angles that distort the grid
   - Ensure the entire grid/clue list is in frame
   - Keep the image as straight as possible

3. **Image Quality**
   - Use highest resolution available
   - Ensure focus is sharp
   - Check that all numbers are readable
   - Verify grid lines are clear

4. **File Format**
   - Preferred: `.jpg` or `.png`
   - Minimum resolution: 1200x1200 pixels
   - Maximum file size: 5MB
   - Color mode: RGB or grayscale

### Image Processing
The program can handle either:
1. **Separate Images**
   - Process grid and clues separately
   - More control over each component
   - Easier to retake if one part is unclear

2. **Combined Image**
   - Single photo of entire puzzle
   - Must be well-lit and clear
   - More challenging for OCR

### Testing Image Quality
Before running the solver:
1. Check that all grid lines are visible
2. Verify clue numbers are readable
3. Ensure clue list text is clear
4. Test OCR on a small section first

If OCR results are poor:
1. Retake the photo with better lighting
2. Try different angles
3. Increase resolution
4. Adjust contrast if needed 

## Verification and Feedback

### Processing Verification
The program provides visual feedback at each stage:

1. **Grid Detection Verification**
   - Shows the detected grid structure
   - Highlights detected black cells
   - Displays detected clue numbers
   - Allows user to confirm or reject the detection

2. **Clue List Verification**
   - Shows parsed clues in a readable format
   - Displays detected parameters (b, c) for each clue
   - Shows calculated lengths (a) from grid
   - Allows user to verify or correct any errors

3. **Solution Progress**
   - Shows current state of the grid during solving
   - Highlights cells being processed
   - Displays number of possible solutions for each clue
   - Shows backtracking progress

### User Interface
The program provides:
1. **Visual Grid Display**
   - ASCII representation of the grid
   - Color-coded cells for different states
   - Clear indication of clue numbers
   - Highlighting of current focus

2. **Clue List Display**
   ```
   Across:
   1. (4 digits) b=3, c=2
   4. (5 digits) b=4, c=3
   ...

   Down:
   1. (4 digits) b=3, c=2
   2. (5 digits) b=4, c=3
   ...
   ```

3. **Interactive Verification**
   - Option to accept detected grid
   - Option to accept detected clues
   - Ability to manually correct errors
   - Confirmation before proceeding to solving

### Error Handling
The program handles:
1. **Grid Detection Errors**
   - Misaligned grid lines
   - Missing clue numbers
   - Incorrect black cell detection

2. **Clue Parsing Errors**
   - Unreadable clue numbers
   - Incorrect parameter detection
   - Missing clues

3. **User Correction**
   - Manual grid adjustment
   - Manual clue parameter entry
   - Clue direction correction
