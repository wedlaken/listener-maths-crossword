# ARCHIVED: Original clue tuple generator with manual mapping
# This file contains the previous clue generation logic for reference
# New implementation will use the systematic approach with 0-63 indexing

# Copy of the current generate_clue_tuples.py logic for archival purposes
# This approach used manual mapping and 1-64 indexing

# 3. Poor validation of clue placement
# 4. Cell overlap problems
